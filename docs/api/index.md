# API

The API is divided into the following modules:

- *sdk*: this module contains the BotMaestroSDK class 

- *model*: this module contains data model classes to make parameters and outputs more manageable.


In order to make it easy for users, all modules are available
via the core module.
```python
from botcity.maestro import *
```

The following sections will describe each module in depth.
