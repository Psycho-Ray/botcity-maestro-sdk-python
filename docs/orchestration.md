# Orchestration

Development is just a step on th process of deploying an automation in production.

After the development is done it is required to set up the runtime environment and execute
the deployment of the automation in production.

When running an automation process in production it is paramount that one can:

- monitor active automations
- synchronize related activities
- schedule tasks
- analyze logs
- visualize artifacts produced

That is the reason why the orchestrator is the most important tool when running your automations in production.

## BotMaestro

BotMaestro is an automation platform to facilitate the development, deploy and orchestration of automation robots.
